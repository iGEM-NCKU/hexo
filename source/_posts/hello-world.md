> iGEM in Tainan

Introduction to iGEM-Tainan

iGEM-Tainan is a student-led team from southern Taiwan composed of university students who participate in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition. Founded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2003, iGEM is a prestigious global competition that encourages students to apply synthetic biology to solve real-world problems in fields such as healthcare, the environment, agriculture, and industry.
Team Philosophy

iGEM-Tainan is committed to a science-based, innovation-driven approach. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and experimental design, the team aims to develop biotechnology solutions with real-world applications. Each year, the team selects a societal issue to address, carrying out the entire process from problem identification and genetic engineering design to lab validation and application development—demonstrating both scientific literacy and creativity.
Project Focus

The projects tackled by iGEM-Tainan are diverse, ranging from environmental remediation and disease diagnostics to agricultural pest control. For example, the team has developed microbial systems that can detect and degrade heavy metal pollutants, as well as RNA-based devices to enhance the sensitivity of pathogen detection. Each project integrates laboratory work, data analysis, mathematical modeling, and public engagement, culminating in a final presentation at the annual iGEM Giant Jamboree.
Education and Public Engagement

In addition to scientific research, iGEM-Tainan actively promotes science education and community outreach. The team collaborates with local schools and communities to host workshops and seminars, aiming to increase public awareness and acceptance of biotechnology and genetic engineering, and to bridge the gap between science and society.
Achievements on the Global Stage

iGEM-Tainan has consistently performed well in the international arena, earning multiple gold medals and special awards in various project categories. Their dedication showcases the potential of Taiwan’s younger generation in scientific innovation and brings local issues and solutions to a global platform, earning widespread recognition.
